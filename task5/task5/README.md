Hello SSMIF team, this is Jorge Ponce. Here is how you have to run my Task 5:

1. (If you haven't already) Download Docker
2. Run Docker
3. While Docker is running, open the terminal in this directory
4. Then type in "docker-compose up --build" and everything will run automatically.
5. Open up http://localhost:3000/ and you will be able to test out the website!

Note: I did the pip install for you in the Dockerfile for the backend and npm install in the Dockerfile for the frontend.
